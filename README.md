Instructions: (lists all the files you plan to create and which task each of these files correspond to.)
For the models, there will have to be at least one yaml file in order to run the models. We mitght need to adjust the path slightly for different tests. Due to this, some paths will have to be created to hold data, predictions, and results.
In addition to this, the tsv files will be made using the replication repo the authors of the text made alongside a python script to appropriately make them into data the models can parse.
Finally, a file where we should the results (graph and plot), which will be in an overleaf write-up.
