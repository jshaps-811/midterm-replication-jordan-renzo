# Replication of Mueller et al. 2020.
This repo contains details regarding a replication attempt of the paper *Cross-Linguistic Syntactic Evaluation of Word Prediction Models* by Mueller et al. 2020. To see the original paper please consult this [link](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.490/), and [this one](https://github.com/aaronmueller/clams) for their repo from which we obtained the testing data.
## How to replicate
The process should be simple, in our folders, we have our first script, `txt_to_tsv.py` which originally utilized the dataset from CLAMS (the original database used in the paper by Mueller et al. 2020) to turn these files into the correct format for our NLP tool, [NLP Scholar](https://github.com/forrestdavis/NLPScholar/). Using this, one can create properly formatted files to be used as input in NLP Scholar. 
Next, the `fname_to_yaml.py` script makes config yaml files for NLP scholar to use, saving them in the proper directories. From there, one can adapt `run.sh` which was made to run NLP Scholar in bulk for all the datafiles. The only change needed is to properly accomodate the file setup for NLP scholar as well as changing the name of the folder being used as data.
